# Readme

You need to put opencv dll's here. For the time being, we're using the EmguCV dll's (which are huge, hence not on the github). You can download them at :

http://sourceforge.net/projects/emgucv/files/latest/download?source=files

The folder contents should look like:
* cublas32_50_35.dll
